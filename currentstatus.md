### `82e4d32` — chore: add currentstatus.md + Amazon Q rule
**Why:** No single source of truth existed for what had been built, what was broken, and what was pending. Manual tracking across conversation summaries was error-prone.
**What changed:**
- `currentstatus.md` — created; tracks every commit, build sheet status, active bugs, verification results, architecture notes
- `.amazonq/rules/update-currentstatus.md` — Amazon Q rule that triggers a currentstatus.md overwrite after every `git commit` or `git push`

### `c97015c` — fix(S3-A+S3-F): moat regression + materiality risk selection
**Why:** S3 Halcyon Run 3 showed Team/Founder Strength (95) winning the moat card instead of EMIR certification. ESG Posture (40) and Network Effects (20) kept winning the Most Material Risk card instead of strategically relevant risks.
**What changed:**
- `src/dimensionRegistry.ts` — Team/Founder, Target Precision, Execution Speed, CAC/LTV, Market Entry Speed marked `moatEligible: false`
- `src/coordinator.ts` — moat prompt now has explicit NEVER list of 10 operational dimensions; valid moat types enumerated
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/KpiRow.tsx` — `STRATEGIC_RISK_PRIORITY` set added; LOW_MATERIALITY expanded; risk card now picks from priority dims first

### `3e3f7a4` — feat: capture and persist all audit inputs + clarifier Q&A in PDF
**Why:** Audit inputs (sector, scale, URL, document) were being lost or bolted onto the context string. Clarifier Q&A questions and answers were never stored — only the merged context blob survived to the PDF.
**What changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/HeroSection.tsx` — sends sector, org_scale, url_source, document_filename as discrete fields; no longer appends `[SECTOR:]` tags to context
- `src/services/sessionService.ts` — `ClarifierTurn` interface added; `StrategySession` has `clarifierExchange[]`, `sector`, `orgScale`, `urlSource`, `documentFilename`; `incrementTurn()` accepts new turn
- `src/services/memory.ts` — `AuditMemory` has `clarifierExchange`, `sector`, `orgScale`, `urlSource`, `documentFilename`; `loadAuditMemory` restores all fields
- `src/index.ts` — receives all new fields; saves to Firestore; sector/scale injected into `taggedContext` for specialists; both saveSession calls updated
- `src/services/pdfService.ts` — Sources Appendix now has 7 sections: Audit Inputs, Original Brief, Strategic Dialogue (Q&A), Data Sources, Missing Signals, Confidence Limitations, Discovery Intelligence

### `9552f85` — fix: normPorter/normAnsoff/normVrio schema detection
**Why:** Porter, Ansoff, VRIO frameworks were not rendering in the Strategic Frameworks tab. The schema normalisers were incorrectly detecting old vs new compact schema.
**What changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/HeroSection.tsx` — `normPorter` checks `raw.scores && typeof raw.scores === 'object'`; `normAnsoff` checks `raw.market_penetration?.score`; `normVrio` checks `raw.valuable?.score`

---

### `b01693a` — feat: Strategic Choice as dedicated card, Stress Simulator own tab
**Why:** Strategic Choice section was buried in prose and getting truncated by the 4096 token limit. Stress Test panel was lost at the bottom of the synthesis tab.
**What changed:**
- `src/coordinator.ts` — Strategic Choice moved to position 2 in synthesis prompt (before Scenario Analysis)
- `frontend/src/components/HeroSection.tsx` — `extractStrategicChoice()` parses 6-field block; renders as styled grid card; `sanitizeReport` strips it from prose
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ReportTabs.tsx` — new `stress` tab added; StressTestPanel moved there

---

### `6309ee9` — fix: 2s backoff before agent retry
**Why:** Finance analyst hit rate limit during critic-triggered retry (S3 Halcyon), causing fallback scores (all 50) for multiple dimensions.
**What changed:**
- `src/coordinator.ts` — `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000))` before retry in failed agent loop

---

### `b1c8b4c` — fix: Build 3.0 Week 1 PDF fixes
**Why:** Multiple PDF rendering issues identified from live audit PDFs.
**What changed:**
- `src/services/pdfService.ts` — Fix 3.A org name (no more "The Venture"); Fix 3.D remove redundant dimension scores page; Fix 3.H unicode glyphs (v, -); Fix 3.I Sources Appendix always renders 4 sections; Fix 3.J page overflow guard tightened to 20px
- `charts-service/charts/wardley.py` — Fix 3.G label truncation: `textwrap.wrap(18)` instead of `name[:22]`

- **LLM:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (synthesis/roadmap), Gemini 2.5 Flash (specialists, critic, moat)
- **Cost per audit:** ~$0.020–0.035, 12 LLM calls, 19K–42K tokens
- **innovation_frameworks schema:** New compact schema (`porter.forces`, `ansoff.vectors`, `vrio.scores`). Frontend normalisers handle both old and new.
- **Moat-eligible dimensions (9):** Competitive Defensibility, Model Innovation, Flywheel Potential, Network Effects Strength, Data Asset Quality, Pricing Power, Regulatory Readiness, Trend Adoption, TAM Viability
